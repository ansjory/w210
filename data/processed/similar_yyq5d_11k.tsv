<p>The short answer is that highly-customized data visualizations cannot be done using function wrappers from the 'lattice' and 'ggplot2' packages.  The purpose of a function wrapper is to take some of the decisions out of your hands, so you will always be limited to the decisions originally envisioned by the function coder.  I highly recommend everyone learn the 'lattice' or 'ggplot2' packages, but these packages are more useful for data exploration than for being creative with data visualizations.</p>

<p><strong>This answer is for those who want to create a customized visual.</strong>  The following process may take half a day, but that is significantly less time than it would take to hack the 'lattice' or 'ggplot2' packages into the shape you want.  This isn't a criticism of either of those packages; it's just a byproduct of their purpose.  When you need a creative visual for a publication or client, 4 or 5 hours of your day is nothing compared to the payoff.</p>

<p>The work to make a customized visual is pretty simple with the 'grid' package, but that doesn't mean the math behind it is always simple.  Most of the work in this example is actually the math and not the graphic.</p>

<p><strong>Preface</strong>: There are some things you should know before you being working with the base 'grid' package for your visuals.  The first is that 'grid' works off the idea of viewports.  These are plotting spaces that allow you to reference from within that space, ignoring the rest of the graphic.  This is important, because it allows you to make graphics without having to scale your work into fractions of the entire space.  It's a lot like the layout options in the base plotting functions, except that they can overlap, be rotated, and made transparent.</p>

<p>Units are another thing to know.  The viewports each have a variety of units that you can use to indicate positions and sizes.  You can see the whole list in the 'grid' documentation, but there are only a few that I use very often: npc, native, strwidth, and lines.  Npc units start at (0,0) in the bottom left and go to c(1,1) in the upper right.  Native units use an 'xscale' and 'yscale' to create what is essentially a plotting space for data.  Strwidth units tell you how wide a certain string of text would be once printed on the graphic.  Lines units tell you how tall a line of text would be once printed on the graphic.  Since multiple types of units are always available, you should get in the habit of always either explicitly defining a number with a 'unit' function or specifying the 'default.units' argument from within your drawing functions.</p>

<p>Finally, you have the ability to specify justifications for all your objects' locations.  This is HUGE.  It means you can specify the location of a shape and then say how you want that shape horizontally and vertically justified (center, left, right, bottom, top).  You can line up things perfectly this way by referencing the location of other objects.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>This is what we are making</strong>:  This isn't a perfect graphic, since I'm having to guess what the OP wants, but it is enough to get us on our way to a perfect graphic.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Op7l1.png"" alt=""demo graph""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Load up some libraries to work with.  When you want to do highly-customized visuals, use the 'grid' package.  It's the base set of functions that wrappers like 'lattice' and 'ggplot2' are calling.  When you want to work with dates, use the 'lubridate' package, because IT MAKES YOUR LIFE BETTER.  This last one is a personal preference: when I'm going to doing any sort of data summary work, I like to use the 'plyr' package.  It allows me to quickly shape my data into aggregate forms.</p>

<pre><code>library(grid)
library(lubridate)
library(plyr)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sample data generation</strong>: This isn't necessary if you already have your data, but for this example, I'm creating a set of sample data.  You can play around with it by changing the user settings for the data generation.  The script is flexible and will adapt to the data generated.  Feel free to add more websites and play around with the lambda values.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, we need to decide how we want our graphic to work.  It's useful to separate things like sizes and colors into a different section of your code, so you can quickly make changes.  Here, I've chosen some basic settings that should produce a decent graphic.  You'll notice that a few of the size settings are using the 'unit' function.  This is one of the amazing things about the 'grid' package.  You can use various units to describe space on your graphic.  For instance, <code>unit(1, ""lines"")</code> is the height of one line of text.  This makes laying out a graphic significantly easier.</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: It's time to make the graphic.  I have limited space for explanations in an SO answer, so I will summarize and then leave the code comments to explain the details.  In a nutshell, I'm calculating how big everything will be and then making the plots one at a time.  For each plot, I format my data first, so I can specify the viewport appropriately.  Then I lay down labels that need to be behind the data, and then I plot the data.  At the end, I ""pop"" the viewport to finalize it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Load up some libraries to work with.  When you want to do highly-customized visuals, use the 'grid' package.  It's the base set of functions that wrappers like 'lattice' and 'ggplot2' are calling.  When you want to work with dates, use the 'lubridate' package, because IT MAKES YOUR LIFE BETTER.  This last one is a personal preference: when I'm going to doing any sort of data summary work, I like to use the 'plyr' package.  It allows me to quickly shape my data into aggregate forms.</p>

<pre><code>library(grid)
library(lubridate)
library(plyr)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sample data generation</strong>: This isn't necessary if you already have your data, but for this example, I'm creating a set of sample data.  You can play around with it by changing the user settings for the data generation.  The script is flexible and will adapt to the data generated.  Feel free to add more websites and play around with the lambda values.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, we need to decide how we want our graphic to work.  It's useful to separate things like sizes and colors into a different section of your code, so you can quickly make changes.  Here, I've chosen some basic settings that should produce a decent graphic.  You'll notice that a few of the size settings are using the 'unit' function.  This is one of the amazing things about the 'grid' package.  You can use various units to describe space on your graphic.  For instance, <code>unit(1, ""lines"")</code> is the height of one line of text.  This makes laying out a graphic significantly easier.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: It's time to make the graphic.  I have limited space for explanations in an SO answer, so I will summarize and then leave the code comments to explain the details.  In a nutshell, I'm calculating how big everything will be and then making the plots one at a time.  For each plot, I format my data first, so I can specify the viewport appropriately.  Then I lay down labels that need to be behind the data, and then I plot the data.  At the end, I ""pop"" the viewport to finalize it.</p>

</code></pre>"	" This question has been sitting long enough, that it is time to document an answer for posterity. The short answer is that highly-customized data visualizations cannot be done using function wrappers from the 'lattice' and 'ggplot2' packages.  The purpose of a function wrapper is to take some of the decisions out of your hands, so you will always be limited to the decisions originally envisioned by the function coder.  I highly recommend everyone learn the 'lattice' or 'ggplot2' packages, but these packages are more useful for data exploration than for being creative with data visualizations. This answer is for those who want to create a customized visual. The following process may take half a day, but that is significantly less time than it would take to hack the 'lattice' or 'ggplot2' packages into the shape you want.  This isn't a criticism of either of those packages; it's just a byproduct of their purpose.  When you need a creative visual for a publication or client, 4 or 5 hours of your day is nothing compared to the payoff. The work to make a customized visual is pretty simple with the 'grid' package, but that doesn't mean the math behind it is always simple.  Most of the work in this example is actually the math and not the graphic. Preface : There are some things you should know before you being working with the base 'grid' package for your visuals.  The first is that 'grid' works off the idea of viewports.  These are plotting spaces that allow you to reference from within that space, ignoring the rest of the graphic.  This is important, because it allows you to make graphics without having to scale your work into fractions of the entire space.  It's a lot like the layout options in the base plotting functions, except that they can overlap, be rotated, and made transparent. Units are another thing to know.  The viewports each have a variety of units that you can use to indicate positions and sizes.  You can see the whole list in the 'grid' documentation, but there are only a few that I use very often: npc, native, strwidth, and lines.  Npc units start at (0,0) in the bottom left and go to c(1,1) in the upper right.  Native units use an 'xscale' and 'yscale' to create what is essentially a plotting space for data.  Strwidth units tell you how wide a certain string of text would be once printed on the graphic.  Lines units tell you how tall a line of text would be once printed on the graphic.  Since multiple types of units are always available, you should get in the habit of always either explicitly defining a number with a 'unit' function or specifying the 'default.units' argument from within your drawing functions. Finally, you have the ability to specify justifications for all your objects' locations.  This is HUGE.  It means you can specify the location of a shape and then say how you want that shape horizontally and vertically justified (center, left, right, bottom, top).  You can line up things perfectly this way by referencing the location of other objects. This is what we are making :  This isn't a perfect graphic, since I'm having to guess what the OP wants, but it is enough to get us on our way to a perfect graphic. Step 1 : Load up some libraries to work with.  When you want to do highly-customized visuals, use the 'grid' package.  It's the base set of functions that wrappers like 'lattice' and 'ggplot2' are calling.  When you want to work with dates, use the 'lubridate' package, because IT MAKES YOUR LIFE BETTER.  This last one is a personal preference: when I'm going to doing any sort of data summary work, I like to use the 'plyr' package.  It allows me to quickly shape my data into aggregate forms. Sample data generation : This isn't necessary if you already have your data, but for this example, I'm creating a set of sample data.  You can play around with it by changing the user settings for the data generation.  The script is flexible and will adapt to the data generated.  Feel free to add more websites and play around with the lambda values. Step 2 : Now, we need to decide how we want our graphic to work.  It's useful to separate things like sizes and colors into a different section of your code, so you can quickly make changes.  Here, I've chosen some basic settings that should produce a decent graphic.  You'll notice that a few of the size settings are using the 'unit' function.  This is one of the amazing things about the 'grid' package.  You can use various units to describe space on your graphic.  For instance, is the height of one line of text.  This makes laying out a graphic significantly easier. Step 3 : It's time to make the graphic.  I have limited space for explanations in an SO answer, so I will summarize and then leave the code comments to explain the details.  In a nutshell, I'm calculating how big everything will be and then making the plots one at a time.  For each plot, I format my data first, so I can specify the viewport appropriately.  Then I lay down labels that need to be behind the data, and then I plot the data.  At the end, I ""pop"" the viewport to finalize it."

But, I believe it is worth providing an answer since there has not been enough information on how to draw inset maps on stack overflow.</p>

<p>I chose ggplot2 to handle this task. First, I downloaded a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame using <code>getData()</code> in the <code>raster</code> package. I converted the data to a regular data frame, which is require for ggplot. Then, I drew the main map (i.e., <code>g1</code>). I used <code>geom_blank()</code> in order to provide longitude and latitude for ggplot. It used to be the case that we could add long and lat in <code>geom_map()</code>, but the current version of ggplot does not accept long and lat as x and y, respectively. I trimmed the map using <code>scale_x_continuous()</code> and <code>scale_y_continuous()</code>. Then, I drew the inset map (i.e., <code>g2</code>). Since I needed to draw a rectangular, I created a data frame called <code>temp</code>. I drew the map in a similar way. Make sure that you treat the inset map as a brow object; you need to use <code>ggplotGrob()</code>. The last step is to add the inset map in the main map. You need to identify the best location.

<p>It would be really nice to add it, but it's probably a bit of work.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're willing to fiddle a bit with the parameters, you can get a decent approximation using the scatter plot, since it allows you to change the size and shape of the dots.</p>

<p>I took the <a href=""http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/examples/heatmap-filtering.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heatmap filtering example</a>, swapped a <code>scatterPlot</code> for the <code>heatmap</code>, changed a few parameters, and got something that works reasonably well:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/maTBO.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/maTBO.png"" alt=""heatmap simulated with scatter plot""></a></p>

<p>First, we can set the width and height to accommodate ""dots"" of size 15x15, just as we do in the heatmap example - except we are stuck with square dots if we use a scatterplot:</p>

<pre><code>        .width(12 * 15 + 40)
        .height(27 * 15 + 20)
        .margins({left: 40, top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 20})
</code></pre>

<p>The margins are for the axis text. </p>

<p>Next, we set the x domain to fit around dots that will be centered on their values:</p>

<pre><code>        .x(d3.scaleLinear().domain([-0.5,11.5]))
        .yAxisPadding(0.5)
</code></pre>

<p>(Not sure why <code>elasticY</code> works but <code>elasticX</code> doesn't... only so much digging you can do at one time.)</p>

<p>Next, we can set the excluded radius to the same as the normal radius, and use grey for excluded dots:</p>

<pre><code>        .symbol(d3.symbolSquare)
        .excludedSize(15)
        .symbolSize(15)
        .excludedColor('#ccc')
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few different ways you could indicate what's filtered in/out - take a look at <a href=""https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/dc.scatterPlot.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the scatterPlot docs</a> for other ideas. For example you could also use <a href=""https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/dc.scatterPlot.html#excludedOpacity__anchor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>excludedOpacity</code></a>. But I find opacity kind of confusing for a heatmap because fading makes it look like it just has a different value rather than being excluded entirely. Season to taste!</p>

<p>Finally, the scatter plot uses ""real"" d3 axes, so the Y axis needs to be configured to display numbers correctly:</p>

<pre><code>            heatmapChart.yAxis().tickFormat(d3.format('.4'))
</code></pre>

<p>Overall, I was surprised how easy this was, since they take the same data format and have most of the same parameters.</p>

It would be really nice to add it, but it's probably a bit of work. In the meantime, if you're willing to fiddle a bit with the parameters, you can get a decent approximation using the scatter plot, since it allows you to change the size and shape of the dots. I took the heatmap filtering example , swapped a for the , changed a few parameters, and got something that works reasonably well: First, we can set the width and height to accommodate ""dots"" of size 15x15, just as we do in the heatmap example - except we are stuck with square dots if we use a scatterplot: The margins are for the axis text. Next, we set the x domain to fit around dots that will be centered on their values: (Not sure why works but doesn't... only so much digging you can do at one time.) Next, we can set the excluded radius to the same as the normal radius, and use grey for excluded dots: There are a few different ways you could indicate what's filtered in/out - take a look at the scatterPlot docs for other ideas.

<p>So you need just change your chart type from <code>logarthmic</code> to any other. Here you can just use default type which is <code>linear</code> according to <a href=""https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/colorAxis.type"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> API reference.
So you can simply comment out <code>type: 'logarithmic'</code>. I made this modification on your code in below link:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> re: y-axis as categorical<br>
With only two continuous-valued axes, it's generally not necessary (nor recommended) to invoke a 3D plotting surface (see, for example, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/24531294/2799941"">this similar discussion</a>).  It's clearer to encode the categorical variable as a labeled dimension.  </p>

<p>This case is additionally complicated by the sample group levels, which represent a fourth dimension.  I'd suggest considering a panel of plots, with y-axis categories encoded as legends.  Like this:</p>

<pre><code>datasets = ['sample4','test5','test6']
line_types = ['-.','--','-']
fix, axes = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(14,5))
for i, data in enumerate([sample4, test5, test6]):
    data.set_index('x').plot(style=line_types[i], ax=axes[i], sharey=True, 
                             xticks=data.x, title=datasets[i])

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> re: y-axis as categorical<br>
With only two continuous-valued axes, it's generally not necessary (nor recommended) to invoke a 3D plotting surface (see, for example, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/24531294/2799941"">this similar discussion</a>).  It's clearer to encode the categorical variable as a labeled dimension.  </p>

<p>This case is additionally complicated by the sample group levels, which represent a fourth dimension.  I'd suggest considering a panel of plots, with y-axis categories encoded as legends.  Like this:</p>

<pre><code>datasets = ['sample4','test5','test6']
line_types = ['-.','--','-']
fix, axes = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(14,5))
