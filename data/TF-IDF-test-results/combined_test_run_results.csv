" What I would do to make this happen is to simply pre-process your data to create two series and then plot both of them onto the same plot.  One series is for 0-179 and the other is for 180-359. You may also want to consider a scatter plot instead of a line plot especially if your data in either of the series is not as smooth as the data in the example.  Meaning that one data point is say 10 and the next one is 110 and then the next one after that is 12 or some such. This code gives you an example, the data is provided by JSON but you should be able to just easily replace it with however your data comes in: I'd like to think that I have a jsfiddle for this somewhere, will update the answer when I dig it up.

" Since DFS and BFS are trivial algorithms, there isn't any need to get them from a library. Yes, they are implemented in BGL but this library is primarily for more complicated algorithms. Also, BGL does provide some graph representations but is actually implemented in a way where you can use your own graph data structure and still apply BGL's algorithms. But differently: implement the graph and the algorithms yourself! For DFS and BFS implementing a graph is fairly straight forward as you don't even need a separate edge type (there is no additional data stored for edges beyond where they point to). To implement a graph you'll need a node type which stores a flag (to indicate if the node was visited) and a container with indicators of the target nodes. Most often, the container just stores pointers to the target node which, of course, means that the nodes pointed to stay put in memory. You could use either a if you only add/remove nodes at one of the ends or a if you may add/remove nodes anywhere in the graph (for implementing DFS and BFS you only add nodes which can be done at the end, i.e., I'd go with ). Internally in the nodes you'd just store a . When inserting an edge between two nodes you just find the two nodes and add a pointer to source node's to the target . If the graph is undirected, you'd add pointers to the of both nodes. BTW, I wouldn't call DFS or BFS ""artificial intelligence"".
