## Problem Statement

People wanting to create data visualizations are faced with reading through and vetting multiple search results to find the guidance they need to create a visualization that fits their need. While they will eventually find an answer, it takes time and energy.

## Mission Statement

Vizziest takes the time, frustration, and guesswork out of finding actionable guidance for creating the data visualization that best meets the userâ€™s business requirements.

Our hypothesis is that given a problem domain such as visualization, we can create models on top of knowledge repositories to generate more helpful, targeted advice than a user would get from a generalized search engine. Once developed, this approach can generalize to other problem domains, for example, predicting data science models most appropriate for a user's business need.

## Impact

Our earlier [survey](https://www.mysurveygizmo.com/s3/5231057/Creating-Data-Visualizations) of data scientists and business analysts with [results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oUGaKxJ1l6I_gCochS7xaTQvEle4b9OJ/view?usp=sharing) indicated that, on average, they create 8.2 data visualizations per month. Assuming they spend 15 minutes per visualization searching for code examples and guidance for each visualization, that means they spend 24.6 hours per year finding answers. The goal of Vizziest is to dramatically reduce this time.
